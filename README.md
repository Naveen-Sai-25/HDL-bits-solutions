# HDL-bits-solutions
This repository contains HDL (Verilog/VHDL) solutions for digital design problems.The codes are written with a focus on clarity, correctness, and synthesizability, following standard HDL coding practices. Each module is designed to help understand core digital concepts such as combinational logic, sequential circuits, FSMs, and timing behavior.
